Objective:
The primary objective of this analysis is to comprehensively investigate the relationship between global temperature anomalies and the occurrences of natural disasters spanning several decades. By leveraging historical datasets on global temperature variations and natural disaster occurrences, this study aims to uncover potential correlations, trends, and implications for climate change and disaster risk management efforts.

Abstract:
This in-depth analysis delves into the intricate interplay between global temperature anomalies and the frequency of natural disasters worldwide. Leveraging two crucial datasets—one capturing global temperature anomalies and the other documenting natural disaster occurrences—this study embarks on a multifaceted exploration of climatic phenomena and their impacts. Through meticulous data preprocessing, rigorous analysis, and insightful visualization, this research offers valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of climate change and its ramifications for natural disaster risk.
